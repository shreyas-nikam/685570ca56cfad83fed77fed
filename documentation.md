# Multiple Regression Lab Codelab

This codelab guides you through a Streamlit application designed to explore and analyze multiple linear regression models. Understanding multiple regression is crucial for data scientists and analysts as it allows you to model the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables. This application provides a user-friendly interface to upload data, select variables, perform regression analysis, visualize results, and assess model assumptions. By the end of this codelab, you'll understand the application's architecture, its different functionalities, and how to extend or modify it for your specific needs.

## Setting up the Environment
Duration: 00:05

Before diving into the application, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. Use pip to install Streamlit, pandas, statsmodels, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly.

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas statsmodels matplotlib seaborn plotly
```

## Understanding the Application Architecture
Duration: 00:10

The application follows a modular design, making it easy to understand and extend. The main file, `app.py`, acts as the entry point and orchestrates the different functionalities. The core logic is divided into separate modules within the `application_pages` directory, each responsible for a specific task: data input, regression results, residual analysis, and scatterplot matrix visualization.
```
.
├── app.py
└── application_pages
    ├── data_input.py
    ├── regression_results.py
    ├── residual_analysis.py
    └── scatterplot_matrix.py
```
`app.py` - This is the main application file. It handles navigation and calls the functions from the other modules.
`application_pages/data_input.py` - This module handles data uploading and variable selection.
`application_pages/regression_results.py` - This module performs the regression analysis and displays the results.
`application_pages/residual_analysis.py` - This module performs residual analysis and displays the plots.
`application_pages/scatterplot_matrix.py` - This module displays the scatterplot matrix.

## Exploring the `app.py` File
Duration: 00:10

Let's start by examining the `app.py` file. This file initializes the Streamlit application, sets the page configuration, defines the navigation, and calls the appropriate functions based on user selection.

```python
import streamlit as st

st.set_page_config(page_title="Multiple Regression Lab", layout="wide")
st.sidebar.image("https://www.quantuniversity.com/assets/img/logo5.jpg")
st.sidebar.divider()
st.title("Multiple Regression Lab")
st.divider()

st.markdown("""
This lab provides an interactive platform for exploring multiple linear regression models. 
You can upload your own datasets, select dependent and independent variables, and visualize the regression results, 
including coefficients, residuals, and diagnostic plots. The application uses insights from statistical principles to guide users 
in understanding the underlying principles and assumptions.
""")

# Navigation
page = st.sidebar.selectbox(
    label="Navigation",
    options=[
        "Data Input & Variable Selection",
        "Regression Results",
        "Residual Analysis",
        "Scatterplot Matrix"
    ]
)

if page == "Data Input & Variable Selection":
    from application_pages.data_input import run_data_input
    run_data_input()
elif page == "Regression Results":
    from application_pages.regression_results import run_regression_results
    run_regression_results()
elif page == "Residual Analysis":
    from application_pages.residual_analysis import run_residual_analysis
    run_residual_analysis()
elif page == "Scatterplot Matrix":
    from application_pages.scatterplot_matrix import run_scatterplot_matrix
    run_scatterplot_matrix()

st.divider()
st.write("© 2025 QuantUniversity. All Rights Reserved.")
st.caption(
    "The purpose of this demonstration is solely for educational use and illustration. "
    "Any reproduction of this demonstration "
    "requires prior written consent from QuantUniversity."
)
```

This code first imports the streamlit library. It sets the page configuration, adds a title and description. A navigation sidebar is created using `st.sidebar.selectbox`. Based on the selected page, the corresponding function from the `application_pages` directory is called.

## Implementing Data Input and Variable Selection
Duration: 00:15

The `data_input.py` file handles the uploading of CSV data and selecting dependent and independent variables. Let's break down the code:

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

def run_data_input():
    st.header("Data Input & Variable Selection")

    # File Uploader
    uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload a CSV file", type=["csv"])

    if uploaded_file is not None:
        try:
            df = pd.read_csv(uploaded_file)
            st.dataframe(df.head())  # Display the first few rows of the dataframe

            # Variable Selection
            column_names = df.columns.tolist()
            dependent_variable = st.selectbox("Select the dependent variable", options=column_names)
            independent_variables = st.multiselect("Select the independent variable(s)", options=column_names)

            # Store selected variables in session state
            st.session_state['data'] = df
            st.session_state['dependent_variable'] = dependent_variable
            st.session_state['independent_variables'] = independent_variables

            st.success("Data loaded and variables selected!")

        except Exception as e:
            st.error(f"Error loading data: {e}")
    else:
        st.info("Please upload a CSV file to proceed.")
```

The `run_data_input` function uses `st.file_uploader` to allow users to upload a CSV file. If a file is uploaded, pandas reads the data into a DataFrame. `st.selectbox` and `st.multiselect` are used to select the dependent and independent variables, respectively. The selected data and variables are stored in `st.session_state` for use in other parts of the application. Error handling is included to catch potential issues during data loading.

<aside class="positive">
<b>Tip:</b> The `st.session_state` is very useful for maintaining state across different pages of the application.
</aside>

## Performing Regression Analysis and Displaying Results
Duration: 00:20

The `regression_results.py` file focuses on performing the multiple linear regression and displaying the results.

```python
import streamlit as st
import statsmodels.api as sm
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf
import pandas as pd

def run_regression_results():
    st.header("Regression Results")

    # Check if data and variables are available in session state
    if 'data' not in st.session_state or 'dependent_variable' not in st.session_state or 'independent_variables' not in st.session_state:
        st.info("Please upload data and select variables on the Data Input page.")
        return

    df = st.session_state['data']
    dependent_variable = st.session_state['dependent_variable']
    independent_variables = st.session_state['independent_variables']

    # Create the regression formula
    formula = f"{dependent_variable} ~ " + " + ".join(independent_variables)

    try:
        # Fit the regression model
        model = smf.ols(formula, data=df).fit()

        # Display the regression summary
        st.subheader("Regression Summary")
        st.write(model.summary())

        # Display the coefficients in a dataframe
        st.subheader("Coefficients")
        coefficients = pd.DataFrame({
            'Coefficient': model.params,
            'Standard Error': model.bse,
            't-statistic': model.tvalues,
            'p-value': model.pvalues
        })
        st.dataframe(coefficients)

    except Exception as e:
        st.error(f"Error fitting the regression model: {e}")
```

This code retrieves the data and selected variables from `st.session_state`.  It constructs the regression formula using the dependent and independent variables. The `statsmodels.formula.api` is used to fit the OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) regression model.  The regression summary and coefficients are displayed using `st.write` and `st.dataframe`, respectively. The coefficients are displayed with standard errors, t-statistics, and p-values for each independent variable.

## Conducting Residual Analysis
Duration: 00:20

The `residual_analysis.py` module helps assess the regression model's assumptions by analyzing the residuals.

```python
import streamlit as st
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import statsmodels.api as sm
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import plotly.express as px

def run_residual_analysis():
    st.header("Residual Analysis")

    # Check if data and variables are available in session state
    if 'data' not in st.session_state or 'dependent_variable' not in st.session_state or 'independent_variables' not in st.session_state:
        st.info("Please upload data and select variables on the Data Input page.")
        return

    df = st.session_state['data']
    dependent_variable = st.session_state['dependent_variable']
    independent_variables = st.session_state['independent_variables']

    # Create the regression formula
    formula = f"{dependent_variable} ~ " + " + ".join(independent_variables)

    try:
        # Fit the regression model
        model = smf.ols(formula, data=df).fit()

        # Calculate residuals and predicted values
        residuals = model.resid
        predicted_values = model.fittedvalues

        # Residual Plot
        st.subheader("Residual Plot")
        fig_resid = px.scatter(x=predicted_values, y=residuals, labels={'x': 'Predicted Values', 'y': 'Residuals'})
        st.plotly_chart(fig_resid)

        # Q-Q Plot
        st.subheader("Q-Q Plot")
        fig_qq = sm.qqplot(residuals, fit=True, line="q")
        st.pyplot(fig_qq.fig)
        plt.close(fig_qq.fig)  # Prevent the plot from displaying twice

    except Exception as e:
        st.error(f"Error fitting the regression model or generating plots: {e}")
```
This module calculates the residuals and predicted values from the fitted regression model. It generates a residual plot (predicted values vs. residuals) using `plotly.express` to check for heteroscedasticity. A Q-Q plot is generated using `statsmodels.api` and `matplotlib.pyplot` to assess the normality of the residuals. Both plots are displayed using `st.plotly_chart` and `st.pyplot` respectively.

## Visualizing Scatterplot Matrix
Duration: 00:15

The `scatterplot_matrix.py` file creates a scatterplot matrix to visualize the relationships between all variables in the dataset.

```python
import streamlit as st
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


def run_scatterplot_matrix():
    st.header("Scatterplot Matrix")

    # Check if data is available in session state
    if 'data' not in st.session_state:
        st.info("Please upload data and select variables on the Data Input page.")
        return

    df = st.session_state['data']

    try:
        # Generate the scatterplot matrix
        st.subheader("Scatterplot Matrix")
        fig = sns.pairplot(df)
        st.pyplot(fig)
        plt.close(fig.fig) #Prevent from displaying twice

    except Exception as e:
        st.error(f"Error generating the scatterplot matrix: {e}")
```

This module uses `seaborn.pairplot` to generate the scatterplot matrix. The resulting plot is displayed using `st.pyplot`. This visualization helps identify potential multicollinearity and non-linear relationships between variables.

## Running the Application
Duration: 00:05

To run the application, navigate to the directory containing `app.py` in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will open the application in your web browser. You can then upload your data, select variables, and explore the regression results and visualizations.

## Extending the Application
Duration: 00:15

This application can be extended in several ways. Here are some ideas:

*   **Adding more diagnostic plots:** You could add other diagnostic plots, such as the Cook's distance plot or the leverage plot, to further assess the model's assumptions and identify influential observations.
*   **Implementing variable selection techniques:** You could add functionality to perform variable selection using techniques like forward selection, backward elimination, or stepwise regression.
*   **Adding support for different regression models:** You could extend the application to support other types of regression models, such as logistic regression or Poisson regression.
*   **Adding interactive data filtering:** Allow users to filter the data before performing regression analysis. This could be useful for exploring different subsets of the data.
*   **Adding a user guide:** Create a comprehensive user guide within the app to help users understand the different features and interpret the results.
