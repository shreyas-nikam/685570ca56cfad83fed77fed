## Overview

This Streamlit application aims to provide an interactive platform for users to explore multiple linear regression models. Users can upload their own datasets, select dependent and independent variables, and visualize the regression results, including coefficients, residuals, and diagnostic plots.  The application uses insights from a provided document on "Basics of Multiple Regression and Underlying Assumptions" to guide users in understanding the underlying principles and assumptions.

## Step-by-Step Development Process

1.  **Data Upload:** Implement a file uploader widget in Streamlit, enabling users to upload datasets in CSV format.
2.  **Variable Selection:** Create dropdown widgets that allow users to select the dependent and independent variables from the uploaded dataset.
3.  **Regression Model:** Implement the multiple linear regression model using the selected variables.
4.  **Regression Results:** Display the regression results, including coefficients, standard errors, t-statistics, and p-values, in a tabular format using Streamlit's `st.dataframe` or similar.
5.  **Residual Plots:** Generate scatter plots of residuals against predicted values and independent variables to assess homoskedasticity.
6.  **Q-Q Plot:** Create a normal Q-Q plot of residuals to check for normality.
7.  **Scatterplot Matrix:** Develop a scatterplot matrix to identify potential multicollinearity.
8.  **User Interface:** Design a user-friendly interface with clear instructions and tooltips to guide users through each step.

## Core Concepts and Mathematical Foundations

### Multiple Linear Regression Model
The multiple linear regression model is represented by the following equation:
$$
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1i} + \beta_2 X_{2i} + \beta_3 X_{3i} + ... + \beta_k X_{ki} + \epsilon_i
$$
Where:
- $Y_i$: Dependent variable for the $i$-th observation
- $\beta_0$: Intercept
- $\beta_j$: Coefficient for the $j$-th independent variable
- $X_{ji}$: The $j$-th independent variable for the $i$-th observation
- $\epsilon_i$: Error term for the $i$-th observation

This formula models the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables. Each coefficient $\beta_j$ represents the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable, holding all other independent variables constant.  This application explores these coefficients and their significance.  This is directly related to Exhibit 1 in the provided documents, showing examples of Regression software.

### Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Estimation
The coefficients in multiple linear regression are typically estimated using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). The goal of OLS is to minimize the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values.
$$
\text{Minimize } \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \hat{Y}_i)^2
$$
Where:
- $Y_i$: Observed value of the dependent variable
- $\hat{Y}_i$: Predicted value of the dependent variable, calculated as $\hat{Y}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1i} + \beta_2 X_{2i} + ... + \beta_k X_{ki}$
- $n$: Number of observations

OLS provides estimates for $\beta_0, \beta_1, ..., \beta_k$ that minimize the sum of squared errors.  This estimation process is done by software detailed in the Exhibit 1 examples.

### R-squared
R-squared ($R^2$) represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
$$
R^2 = 1 - \frac{\text{Sum of Squares Residuals (SSR)}}{\text{Total Sum of Squares (SST)}}
$$
Where:
- $SSR = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \hat{Y}_i)^2$
- $SST = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \bar{Y})^2$
- $\bar{Y}$: The mean of the dependent variable

R-squared ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a better fit of the model to the data. It indicates how well the model explains the variability of the dependent variable.

### Adjusted R-squared
Adjusted R-squared is a modified version of R-squared that adjusts for the number of independent variables in the model.
$$
\text{Adjusted } R^2 = 1 - \frac{(1 - R^2)(n - 1)}{n - k - 1}
$$
Where:
- $n$: Number of observations
- $k$: Number of independent variables

Adjusted R-squared penalizes the inclusion of irrelevant independent variables, providing a more accurate measure of the model's goodness of fit.

### Standard Error of Regression (SER)
The Standard Error of Regression (SER) measures the average distance that the observed values fall from the regression line.
$$
SER = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \hat{Y}_i)^2}{n - k - 1}}
$$
Where:
- $Y_i$: Observed value of the dependent variable
- $\hat{Y}_i$: Predicted value of the dependent variable
- $n$: Number of observations
- $k$: Number of independent variables

SER provides an estimate of the typical size of the forecast errors.

### T-statistic
The t-statistic is used to determine the significance of each independent variable in the regression model.
$$
t = \frac{\hat{\beta_j}}{\text{SE}(\hat{\beta_j})}
$$
Where:
- $\hat{\beta_j}$: Estimated coefficient of the $j$-th independent variable
- $SE(\hat{\beta_j})$: Standard error of the estimated coefficient

The t-statistic measures how many standard errors the estimated coefficient is away from zero. A higher absolute value of the t-statistic indicates stronger evidence against the null hypothesis that the coefficient is zero.

### P-value
The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the statistic obtained, assuming the null hypothesis is true.  In the context of regression, the null hypothesis is usually that a particular coefficient is zero (no effect).
A small p-value (typically $\leq 0.05$) suggests strong evidence against the null hypothesis, indicating that the coefficient is statistically significant.

### Residual Analysis

#### Homoskedasticity
Homoskedasticity refers to the condition where the variance of the error terms is constant across all levels of the independent variables.
Violation of homoskedasticity (heteroskedasticity) can lead to inefficient estimates of the regression coefficients.

#### Independence of Errors
The errors (residuals) should be independent of each other.  Correlation between errors, especially in time series data, is called autocorrelation and violates this assumption.

#### Normality of Residuals
The residuals should be normally distributed. This assumption is important for statistical inference (hypothesis testing) and confidence interval construction.

### Diagnostic Plots
#### Residual Plot
A residual plot is a scatter plot of residuals versus predicted values or independent variables. It helps to assess homoskedasticity and linearity.  Randomly scattered residuals indicate homoskedasticity, while patterns suggest heteroskedasticity or non-linearity.

#### Q-Q Plot
A Q-Q (quantile-quantile) plot compares the distribution of residuals to a normal distribution. If the residuals are normally distributed, the points will fall along a straight line. Deviations from the line suggest non-normality. This plots relationship to the source document's Exhibit 8.

#### Scatterplot Matrix
A scatterplot matrix displays pairwise scatterplots of all variables in the dataset. It helps to identify potential multicollinearity (high correlation between independent variables), which can inflate standard errors and make it difficult to interpret the coefficients.  This is directly related to the document's code block using Python and R to demonstrate scatterplot matricies.
