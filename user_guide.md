# Multiple Regression Lab User Guide

Welcome to the Multiple Regression Lab! This application provides an interactive environment for exploring multiple linear regression models. It allows you to upload your own datasets, select dependent and independent variables, visualize regression results, and analyze residuals. The application is designed to enhance your understanding of multiple regression principles and assumptions.

## Data Input & Variable Selection
Duration: 00:05

This section allows you to upload your data and specify the variables for your regression model.

1.  **Upload Data:** Use the "Upload a CSV file" button to upload your dataset in CSV format.
2.  **View Data:** After uploading, the first few rows of your data will be displayed in a table for you to verify the upload was successful.
3.  **Select Dependent Variable:** Choose your dependent variable (the variable you want to predict) from the "Select the dependent variable" dropdown.
4.  **Select Independent Variables:** Select one or more independent variables (the variables you believe influence the dependent variable) from the "Select the independent variable(s)" multiselect box.

<aside class="positive">
<b>Tip:</b> Ensure your CSV file is properly formatted with column headers for easy variable selection.

## Regression Results
Duration: 00:05

This section displays the results of the multiple regression model.

1.  **Regression Summary:** A detailed regression summary table is displayed, including key statistics such as R-squared, adjusted R-squared, F-statistic, and p-values. These statistics help you assess the overall fit and significance of the model.
2.  **Coefficients Table:** A table of coefficients is shown, including the estimated coefficient for each independent variable, standard errors, t-statistics, and p-values. This table helps you understand the relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable, as well as the statistical significance of each relationship.

<aside class="negative">
<b>Warning:</b> Make sure to properly interpret the regression summary and coefficients. High R-squared does not always mean the model is good. Also ensure the coefficients are statistically significant (p-value < 0.05) to confidently draw conclusions.
</aside>

## Residual Analysis
Duration: 00:05

This section provides tools to analyze the residuals of the regression model, helping you assess the validity of the model's assumptions.

1.  **Residual Plot:** A scatter plot of predicted values versus residuals is displayed. This plot helps you check for homoscedasticity (constant variance of residuals) and linearity. Look for a random scatter of points; patterns may indicate violations of these assumptions.
2.  **Q-Q Plot:** A Q-Q (quantile-quantile) plot compares the distribution of the residuals to a normal distribution. This plot helps you assess the normality assumption of the residuals. Points should fall close to the diagonal line if the residuals are normally distributed.

<aside class="positive">
<b>Tip:</b> Residual analysis is crucial for validating your regression model. Deviations from the assumptions can impact the reliability of your results.
</aside>

## Scatterplot Matrix
Duration: 00:05

This section visualizes the relationships between all pairs of variables in your dataset using a scatterplot matrix.

1.  **Scatterplot Matrix:** A grid of scatterplots is displayed, showing the pairwise relationships between all variables in the dataset. This matrix helps you identify potential multicollinearity (high correlation between independent variables) and non-linear relationships.

<aside class="negative">
<b>Warning:</b> High multicollinearity can make it difficult to interpret the individual effects of independent variables.
